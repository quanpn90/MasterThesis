# Thang Luong's Thesis
Following my advisor <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Chris Manning</a>'s recent preference towards <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/in-defense-of-extreme-openness">extreme openness</a>, I put my thesis online. Feel free to comment and encourage me to make progress!

The latest state of the thesis can be found <a

Acknowledgment: thanks to <a href="http://stanford.edu/~angeli/">Gabor
Angeli</a> for sharing the thesis setup!
